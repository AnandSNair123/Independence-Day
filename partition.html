                In 1905, during his second term as Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon divided the Bengal Presidency—the largest 
                administrative subdivision in British India—into the Muslim-majority province of Eastern Bengal and Assam
                 and the Hindu-majority province of Bengal (present-day Indian states of West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, 
                 and Odisha).Curzon's act, the partition of Bengal—which had been contemplated by various colonial 
                 administrations since the time of Lord William Bentinck, though never acted upon—was to transform 
                 nationalist politics as nothing else before it.
                 <br>
                 <br>

The Hindu elite of Bengal, many of whom owned land that was leased out to Muslim peasants in East Bengal, protested 
strongly. The large Bengali-Hindu middle-class (the Bhadralok), upset at the prospect of Bengalis being outnumbered 
in the new Bengal province by Biharis and Oriyas, felt that Curzon's act was punishment for their political assertiveness.
 The pervasive protests against Curzon's decision predominantly took the form of the Swadeshi ('buy Indian') campaign, 
involving a boycott of British goods. Sporadically, but flagrantly, the protesters also took to political violence, which 
involved attacks on civilians. The violence, however, would be ineffective, as most planned attacks were either 
pre-empted by the British or failed. The rallying cry for both types of protest was the slogan Bande Mataram 
(Bengali, lit: 'Hail to the Mother'), the title of a song by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, which invoked a mother goddess,
 who stood variously for Bengal, India, and the Hindu goddess Kali. The unrest spread from Calcutta to the surrounding
  regions of Bengal when Calcutta's English-educated students returned home to their villages and towns.The religious 
  stirrings of the slogan and the political outrage over the partition were combined as young men, in such groups as Jugantar, 
  took to bombing public buildings, staging armed robberies, and assassinating British officials. Since Calcutta was 
  the imperial capital, both the outrage and the slogan soon became known nationally.
  <br>
  <br>
The overwhelming, predominantly-Hindu protest against the partition of Bengal, along with the fear of reforms favouring the
 Hindu majority, led the Muslim elite of India in 1906 to the new viceroy Lord Minto, asking for separate electorates for
  Muslims. In conjunction, they demanded proportional legislative representation reflecting both their status as former 
  rulers and their record of cooperating with the British. This would result in the founding of the All-India Muslim League
   in Dacca in December 1906. Although Curzon by now had returned to England following his resignation over a dispute with 
   his military chief, Lord Kitchener, the League was in favor of his partition plan. The Muslim elite's position, which was
    reflected in the League's position, had crystallized gradually over the previous three decades, beginning with the 1871
     Census of British India, which had first estimated the populations in regions of Muslim majority. For his part, 
     Curzon's desire to court the Muslims of East Bengal had arisen from British anxieties ever since the 1871 census, and 
     in light of the history of Muslims fighting them in the 1857 Mutiny and the Second Anglo-Afghan War.
     <br>
     <br>
In the three decades since the 1871 census, Muslim leaders across northern India had intermittently experienced public 
animosity from some of the new Hindu political and social groups. The Arya Samaj, for example, had not only supported 
Cow Protection Societies in their agitation, but also—distraught at the Census' Muslim numbers—organized "reconversion"
 events for the purpose of welcoming Muslims back to the Hindu fold. In the United Provinces, Muslims became anxious in 
 the late-19th century as Hindu political representation increased, and Hindus were politically mobilized in the Hindi-Urdu 
 controversy and the anti-cow-killing riots of 1893. In 1905 Muslim fears grew when Tilak and Lajpat Rai attempted to 
 rise to leadership positions in the Congress, and the Congress itself rallied around the symbolism of Kali. It was not 
 lost on many Muslims, for example, that the bande mataram rallying cry had first appeared in the novel Anandmath in which 
 Hindus had battled their Muslim oppressors. Lastly, the Muslim elite, including Nawab of Dacca, Khwaja Salimullah, who 
 hosted the League's first meeting in his mansion in Shahbag, was aware that a new province with a Muslim majority would 
 directly benefit Muslims aspiring to political power.
 <br>
 <br>
The Partition of India was the division of British India into two independent Dominions: India and Pakistan. The two 
states have since gone through further reorganization: the Dominion of India is today the Republic of India (since 1950); 
while the Dominion of Pakistan was composed of what is known today as the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (since 1956) and the 
People's Republic of Bangladesh (since 1971). The partition involved the division of two provinces, Bengal and Punjab, based 
on district-wide non-Muslim or Muslim majorities. The partition also saw the division of the British Indian Army, the Royal 
Indian Navy, the Indian Civil Service, the railways, and the central treasury. The partition was outlined in the Indian 
Independence Act 1947 and resulted in the dissolution of the British Raj, i.e. Crown rule in India. The two self-governing 
independent Dominions of India and Pakistan legally came into existence at midnight on 15 August 1947.
<br>
                 <br>
The partition displaced between 10 and 20 million people along religious lines, creating overwhelming refugee crises in 
the newly constituted dominions. There was large-scale violence, with estimates of the loss of life accompanying
 or preceding the partition disputed and varying between several hundred thousand and two million.The violent nature 
 of the partition created an atmosphere of hostility and suspicion between India and Pakistan that affects their relationship
  to this day.
  <br>
  <br>
The term partition of India does not cover the secession of Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971, nor the earlier separations of 
Burma (now Myanmar) and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) from the administration of British India. The term also does not cover the
 political integration of princely states into the two new dominions, nor the disputes of annexation or division arising in 
 the princely states of Hyderabad, Junagadh, and Jammu and Kashmir, though violence along religious lines did break out in 
 some princely states at the time of the partition. It does not cover the incorporation of the enclaves of French India into
  India during the period 1947–1954, nor the annexation of Goa and other districts of Portuguese India by India in 1961. 
  Other contemporaneous political entities in the region in 1947—the Kingdom of Sikkim, Kingdom of Bhutan, Kingdom of Nepal,
   and the Maldives—were unaffected by the partition.
   <br>
   <br>
Among princely states, the violence was often highly organised with the involvement or complicity of the rulers. It is 
believed that in the Sikh states (except for Jind and Kapurthala), the Maharajas were complicit in the ethnic cleansing 
of Muslims, while other Maharajas such as those of Patiala, Faridkot, and Bharatpur were heavily involved in ordering them. 
The ruler of Bharatpur, in particular, is said to have witnessed the ethnic cleansing of his population, especially at places 
such as Deeg.
