            The Indian Rebellion of 1857 occurred as the result of an accumulation of factors over time, rather than any 
            single event.
<br>
<br>
The sepoys were Indian soldiers who were recruited into the Company's army. Just before the rebellion, there were over 
300,000 sepoys in the army, compared to about 50,000 British. The forces were divided into three presidency armies: 
Bombay, Madras, and Bengal. The Bengal Army recruited higher castes, such as Rajputs, Ahirs and Bhumihar, mostly from 
the Awadh and Bihar regions, and even restricted the enlistment of lower castes in 1855. In contrast, the Madras Army 
and Bombay Army were "more localized, caste-neutral armies" that "did not prefer high-caste men". The domination 
of higher castes in the Bengal Army has been blamed in part for initial mutinies that led to the rebellion.
<br>
<br>

Two sepoy officers; a private sepoy, 1820s
In 1772, when Warren Hastings was appointed India's first Governor-General, one of his first undertakings was the rapid 
expansion of the Company's army. Since the sepoys from Bengal – many of whom had fought against the Company in the Battles 
of Plassey and Buxar – were now suspect in British eyes, Hastings recruited farther west from the high-caste rural Rajputs 
and Bhumihar of Awadh and Bihar, a practice that continued for the next 75 years. However, in order to forestall any social 
friction, the Company also took action to adapt its military practices to the requirements of their religious rituals. 
Consequently, these soldiers dined in separate facilities; in addition, overseas service, considered polluting to their 
caste, was not required of them, and the army soon came officially to recognise Hindu festivals. "This encouragement of 
high caste ritual status, however, left the government vulnerable to protest, even mutiny, whenever the sepoys detected 
infringement of their prerogatives." Stokes argues that "The British scrupulously avoided interference with the social 
structure of the village community which remained largely intact."
<br>
<br>
After the annexation of Oudh (Awadh) by the East India Company in 1856, many sepoys were disquieted both from losing their
 perquisites, as landed gentry, in the Oudh courts, and from the anticipation of any increased land-revenue payments that 
 the annexation might bring about.Other historians have stressed that by 1857, some Indian soldiers, interpreting the 
 presence of missionaries as a sign of official intent, were convinced that the Company was masterminding mass conversions 
 of Hindus and Muslims to Christianity. Although earlier in the 1830s, evangelicals such as William Carey and William 
 Wilberforce had successfully clamoured for the passage of social reform, such as the abolition of sati and allowing the 
 remarriage of Hindu widows, there is little evidence that the sepoys' allegiance was affected by this.
 <br>
 <br>
However, changes in the terms of their professional service may have created resentment. As the extent of the East India 
Company's jurisdiction expanded with victories in wars or annexation, the soldiers were now expected not only to serve in 
less familiar regions, such as in Burma, but also to make do without the "foreign service" remuneration that had previously 
been their due.
<br>
<br>
A major cause of resentment that arose ten months prior to the outbreak of the rebellion was the General Service Enlistment
 Act of 25 July 1856. As noted above, men of the Bengal Army had been exempted from overseas service. Specifically, they were 
 enlisted only for service in territories to which they could march. Governor-General Lord Dalhousie saw this as an anomaly, 
 since all sepoys of the Madras and Bombay Armies and the six "General Service" battalions of the Bengal Army had accepted 
 an obligation to serve overseas if required. As a result, the burden of providing contingents for active service in Burma, 
 readily accessible only by sea, and China had fallen disproportionately on the two smaller Presidency Armies. As signed into 
 effect by Lord Canning, Dalhousie's successor as Governor-General, the act required only new recruits to the Bengal Army to
  accept a commitment for general service. However, serving high-caste sepoys were fearful that it would be eventually 
  extended to them, as well as preventing sons following fathers into an army with a strong tradition of family service.
  <br>
  <br>
  The rebellion began on 10 May 1857 in the form of a mutiny of sepoys of the Company's army in the garrison town of 
  Meerut, 40 mi (64 km) northeast of Delhi (that area is now Old Delhi). It then erupted into other mutinies and civilian
   rebellions chiefly in the upper Gangetic plain and central India, though incidents of revolt also occurred 
   farther north and east. The rebellion posed a considerable threat to British power in that region, and was 
   contained only with the rebels' defeat in Gwalior on 20 June 1858. On 1 November 1858, the British granted amnesty 
   to all rebels not involved in murder, though they did not declare the hostilities to have formally ended until 8 July 
   1859. Its name is contested, and it is variously described as the Sepoy Mutiny, the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, 
   the Revolt of 1857, the Indian Insurrection, and the First War of Independence.
   <br>
   <br>
The Indian rebellion was fed by resentments born of diverse perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, 
harsh land taxes, summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, as well as scepticism about the improvements
 brought about by British rule. Many Indians rose against the British; however, many also fought for the British, and 
 the majority remained seemingly compliant to British rule. Violence, which sometimes betrayed exceptional cruelty, 
 was inflicted on both sides, on British officers, and civilians, including women and children, by the rebels, and on the 
 rebels, and their supporters, including sometimes entire villages, by British reprisals; the cities of Delhi and Lucknow
  were laid waste in the fighting and the British retaliation.
  <br>
  <br>
After the outbreak of the mutiny in Meerut, the rebels quickly reached Delhi, whose 81-year-old Mughal ruler, Bahadur Shah 
Zafar, was declared the Emperor of Hindustan. Soon, the rebels had captured large tracts of the North-Western Provinces and 
Awadh (Oudh). The East India Company's response came rapidly as well. With help from reinforcements, Kanpur was retaken by 
mid-July 1857, and Delhi by the end of September. However, it then took the remainder of 1857 and the better part of 
1858 for the rebellion to be suppressed in Jhansi, Lucknow, and especially the Awadh countryside. Other regions of 
Company-controlled India—Bengal province, the Bombay Presidency, and the Madras Presidency—remained largely calm.
In the Punjab, the Sikh princes crucially helped the British by providing both soldiers and support. The large 
princely states, Hyderabad, Mysore, Travancore, and Kashmir, as well as the smaller ones of Rajputana, did not join the 
rebellion, serving the British, in the Governor-General Lord Canning's words, as "breakwaters in a storm."
<br>
  <br>
In some regions, most notably in Awadh, the rebellion took on the attributes of a patriotic revolt against British 
oppression. However, the rebel leaders proclaimed no articles of faith that presaged a new political system.
Even so, the rebellion proved to be an important watershed in Indian and British Empire history. It led to the 
dissolution of the East India Company, and forced the British to reorganize the army, the financial system, and the 
administration in India, through passage of the Government of India Act 1858. India was thereafter administered 
directly by the British government in the new British Raj.On 1 November 1858, Queen Victoria issued a proclamation 
to Indians, which while lacking the authority of a constitutional provision, promised rights similar to those of 
other British subjects. In the following decades, when admission to these rights was not always forthcoming, 
Indians were to pointedly refer to the Queen's proclamation in growing avowals of a new nationalism.
