<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
The Independence Day of India, which is celebrated  throughout the country on  15th of August every year, holds tremendous ground in the list 
of national days, since it reminds every Indian about the dawn of a new beginning,
the beginning of an era of deliverance from the clutches of British colonialism of more than 200 years. It was on 15th August 1947 that India 
was declared independent from British colonialism, and the reins of control were handed over to the leaders of 
the Country. India's gaining of independence was a tryst with destiny, as the struggle for freedom was a long 
and tiresome one, witnessing the sacrifices of many freedom fighters, who laid down their lives on the line.
<br>
<br>
Independence coincided with the partition of India, in which British India was divided along religious lines into the Dominions
 of India and Pakistan; the partition was accompanied by violent riots and mass casualties, and the displacement of nearly 15 
 million people due to religious violence. On 15 August 1947, the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru raised the 
 Indian national flag above the Lahori Gate of the Red Fort in Delhi. On each subsequent Independence Day, the incumbent 
 Prime Minister customarily raises the flag and gives an address to the nation. The entire event is broadcast by Doordarshan,
 India's national broadcaster, and usually begins with the shehnai music of Ustad Bismillah Khan.
 <br>
 <br>
 At the 1929 Lahore session of the Indian National Congress, the Purna Swaraj declaration, or "Declaration of the Independence 
 of India" was promulgated, and 26 January 1930 was declared as Independence Day at that time. The Congress called on
  people to pledge themselves to civil disobedience and "to carry out the Congress instructions issued from time to time"
   until India attained complete independence. Celebration of such an Independence Day was envisioned to stoke nationalistic
    fervour among Indian citizens, and to force the British government to consider granting independence.The Congress
     observed 26 January as the Independence Day between 1930 and 1946. The celebration was marked by meetings where 
     the attendants took the "pledge of independence". Jawaharlal Nehru described in his autobiography that such 
     meetings were peaceful, solemn, and "without any speeches or exhortation". Gandhi envisaged that besides the meetings, 
     the day would be spent " ... in doing some constructive work, whether it is spinning, or service of 'untouchables,' or 
     reunion of Hindus and Mussalmans, or prohibition work, or even all these together". Following actual independence in 
     1947, the Constitution of India came into effect on and from 26 January 1950; since then 26 January is celebrated as 
     Republic Day.

     European traders had established outposts in the Indian subcontinent by the 17th century. Through overwhelming military 
     strength, the East India Company fought and annexed local kingdoms and established themselves as the dominant force by 
     the 18th century. Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led the British Crown to 
     assume direct control of India. In the decades following, civic society gradually emerged across India, most notably 
     the Indian National Congress Party, formed in 1885.The period after World War I was marked by colonial 
     reforms such as the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms, but it also witnessed the enactment of the unpopular Rowlatt Act and 
     calls for self-rule by Indian activists. The discontent of this period crystallised into nationwide non-violent movements 
     of non-cooperation and civil disobedience, led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.
<br>
<br>
During the 1930s, the reform was gradually legislated by the British; Congress won victories in the resulting elections.
The next decade was beset with political turmoil: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress' final 
push for non-cooperation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism led by the All-India Muslim League. The escalating political 
tension was capped by Independence in 1947. The jubilation was tempered by the bloody partition of the subcontinent into 
India and Pakistan.
<br>
<br>
Millions of Muslim, Sikh and Hindu refugees trekked the newly drawn borders in the months surrounding independence.
In Punjab, where the borders divided the Sikh regions in halves, massive bloodshed followed; in Bengal and Bihar, where 
Mahatma Gandhi's presence assuaged communal tempers, the violence was mitigated. In all, between 250,000 and 1,000,000 
people on both sides of the new borders died in the violence. While the entire nation was celebrating the Independence
 Day, Gandhi stayed in Calcutta in an attempt to stem the carnage. On 14 August 1947, the Independence Day of Pakistan, 
 the new Dominion of Pakistan came into being; Muhammad Ali Jinnah was sworn in as its first Governor General in Karachi.
 <br>
 <br>
The Constituent Assembly of India met for its fifth session at 11 pm on 14 August in the Constitution Hall in New Delhi.
The session was chaired by the president Rajendra Prasad. In this session, Jawaharlal Nehru delivered the Tryst with Destiny 
speech proclaiming India's independence.
<br>
<br>
Long years ago we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full 
measure, but very substantially. At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and 
freedom. A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history when we step out from the old to the new when an age ends, and
 when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance. It is fitting that at this solemn moment, we take the pledge 
 of dedication to the service of India and her people and to the still larger cause of humanity.
 <br>
 <br>
— Tryst with Destiny speech, Jawaharlal Nehru, 15 August 1947
<br>
<br>
The members of the Assembly formally took the pledge of being in the service of the country. A group of women, representing 
the women of India, formally presented the national flag to the assembly.
<br>
<br>
The Dominion of India became an independent country as official ceremonies took place in New Delhi. Nehru assumed office as 
the first prime minister, and the viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, continued as its first governor general. Gandhi's name was
 invoked by crowds celebrating the occasion; Gandhi himself however took no part in the official events. Instead, he marked 
 the day with a 24-hour fast, during which he spoke to a crowd in Calcutta, encouraging peace between Hindus and Muslims.
