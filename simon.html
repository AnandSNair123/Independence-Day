             The Indian Statutory Commission also known as Simon Commison', was a group of seven Members of Parliament 
            under the chairmanship of Sir John Simon (later, 1st Viscount Simon). The commission arrived in British India in 
            1928 to study constitutional reform in Britain's largest and most important possession. One of its members
            was the future leader of the Labour Party Clement Attlee, who became committed to self-government for 
            India.
<br>
<br>
At the time of introducing the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms in 1919, the British Government declared that a commission would 
be sent to India after ten years to examine the effects and operations of the constitutional reforms and to suggest more 
reforms for India.
<br>
<br>
In November 1927, the British government appointed the Simon Commission to report on India's constitutional progress for 
introducing constitutional reforms, as promised. The Commission was strongly opposed by many Indians. It was opposed by 
Nehru, Gandhi, Jinnah, the Muslim League and Indian National Congress because it contained seven members of the British 
Parliament but no Indians. Indians saw it as a violation to their right of self determination and insult to their self 
respect. However it was supported by B R Ambedkar and Periyar E. V. Ramasamy.
<br>
<br>
The Commission published its 2-volume report in May 1930. It proposed the abolition of dyarchy and the establishment of 
representative government in the provinces. It also recommended that separate communal electorates be retained, but only 
until tensions between Hindus and Muslims had died down. In September 1928, ahead of the Commission's release, Motilal 
Nehru presented his Nehru Report to counter its charges that Indians could not find a constitutional consensus among 
themselves. This report advocated that India be given dominion status of complete internal self-government.
<br>
<br>
Noting that educated Indians opposed the Commission and also that communal tensions had increased instead of decreased, 
the British government opted for another method of dealing with the constitutional issues of India. Before the publication 
of the report, the British government stated that Indian opinion would henceforth be taken into account, and that the natural
 outcome of the constitutional process would be dominion status for India.
 <br>
 <br>
The outcome of the Simon Commission was the Government of India Act 1935, which called for "responsible" government at the 
provincial level in India but not at the national level—that is a government responsible to the Indian community rather than 
London. It is the basis of many parts of the Indian Constitution. In 1937 the first elections were held in the Provinces, 
resulting in Congress Governments being returned in almost all Provinces.
<br>
<br>
Clement Attlee was deeply moved by his experience on the Commission, and endorsed the final report. However by 1933 he argued 
that British rule was alien to India and was unable to make the social and economic reforms necessary for India's progress. 
He became the British leader most sympathetic to Indian independence (as a dominion), preparing him for his role in deciding
 on Indian independence as British Prime Minister in 1947.
 <br>
 <br>
 The Simon Commission left England in January 1928. Almost immediately with its arrival in Bombay on 4 February 1928, 
 its members were confronted by throngs of protesters, although there were also some supporters among the crowds who saw 
 it as the next step on the road to self-governance. A strike began and many people turned out to greet the Commission 
 with black flags. Similar protests occurred in every major Indian city that the seven British MPs visited.

One protest against the Simon Commission became infamous. On 30 October 1928, the Commission arrived in Lahore where it 
was met by protesters waving black flags. The protest was led by the Indian nationalist Lala Lajpat Rai, who had moved 
a resolution against the Commission in the Legislative Assembly of Punjab in February 1928. In order to make way for the 
Commission, the local police force began beating protestors. Lala Lajpat Rai was critically injured and died a fortnight 
later.
