            In Punjab, the situation was deteriorating rapidly, with disruptions of rail, telegraph, and communication systems.
             The movement was at its peak before the end of the first week of April, with some recording that "practically the whole 
             of Lahore was on the streets, the immense crowd that passed through Anarkali was estimated to be around 20,000. Many
             officers in the Indian army believed revolt was possible, and they prepared for the worst. The British Lieutenant-Governor
              of Punjab, Michael O'Dwyer, is said to have believed that these were the early and ill-concealed signs of a conspiracy 
              for a coordinated revolt planned around May, on the lines of the 1857 revolt, at a time when British troops would have
               withdrawn to the hills for the summer.
               <br>
               <br>

            The Amritsar massacre and other events at about the same time, have been described by some historians as the end result 
            of a concerted plan by the Punjab administration to suppress such a conspiracy.James Houssemayne Du Boulay is said
             to have ascribed a direct relationship between the fear of a Ghadarite uprising in the midst of an increasingly tense 
             situation in Punjab, and the British response that ended in the massacre.
             <br>
             <br>
            On 10 April 1919, there was a protest at the residence of Miles Irving, the Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar. The
             demonstration was to demand the release of two popular leaders of the Indian Independence Movement, Satya Pal and 
             Saifuddin Kitchlew, who had been earlier arrested by the government and moved to a secret location. Both were proponents
              of the Satyagraha movement led by Gandhi. A military picket shot at the crowd, killing several protesters and setting 
              off a series of violent events. Riotous crowds carried out arson attacks on British banks, killed several British people 
              and assaulted two British females.

            All native men were forced to crawl the Kucha Kurrichhan on their hands and knees as punishment, 1919
            On 11 April, Marcella Sherwood, an elderly English missionary, fearing for the safety of the approximately 600 Indian
             children under her care, was on her way to shut the schools and send the children home. While travelling through
              a narrow street called the Kucha Kurrichhan, she was caught by a mob who violently attacked her. She was rescued by 
              some local Indians, including the father of one of her pupils, who hid her from the mob and then smuggled her to the
               safety of Gobindgarh Fort. After visiting Sherwood on 19 April, the Raj's local commander, Colonel Dyer,
                enraged at the assault, issued an order requiring every Indian man using that street to crawl its length on his 
                hands and knees as a punishment. Colonel Dyer later explained to a British inspector: "Some Indians crawl 
                face downwards in front of their gods. I wanted them to know that a British woman is as sacred as a Hindu god and 
                therefore they have to crawl in front of her, too." He also authorised the indiscriminate, public whipping of 
                locals who came within lathi length of British policemen. Marcella Sherwood later defended Colonel Dyer, describing
                 him "as the saviour of the Punjab"
                 <br>
                 <br>
            For the next two days, the city of Amritsar was quiet, but violence continued in other parts of Punjab. Railway lines 
            were cut, telegraph posts destroyed, government buildings burnt, and three Europeans murdered. By 13 April, the British
             government had decided to put most of Punjab under martial law. The legislation restricted a number of civil liberties,
              including freedom of assembly; gatherings of more than four people were banned.
              <br>
              <br>
            On the evening of 12 April, the leaders of the hartal in Amritsar held a meeting at the Hindu College - Dhab Khatikan. 
            At the meeting, Hans Raj, an aide to Kitchlew, announced a public protest meeting would be held at 18:30 the following 
            day in the Jallianwala Bagh, to be organised by Muhammad Bashir and chaired by a senior and respected Congress Party
             leader, Lal Kanhyalal Bhatia. A series of resolutions protesting against the Rowlatt Act, the recent actions of the 
             British authorities and the detention of Satyapal and Kitchlew was drawn up and approved, after which the meeting 
             adjourned.
             <br>
             <br>
             The Jallianwala Bagh massacre, also known as the Amritsar massacre, took place on 13 April 1919. A large but 
             peaceful crowd had gathered at the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar, Punjab to protest against the arrest of 
             pro-Indian independence leaders Dr. Saifuddin Kitchlu and Dr. Satya Pal. In response to the public gathering,
              the British Brigadier-General R. E. H. Dyer surrounded the Bagh with his soldiers. The Jallianwala Bagh could 
              only be exited on one side, as its other three sides were enclosed by buildings. After blocking the exit with
               his troops, he ordered them to shoot at the crowd, continuing to fire even as protestors tried to flee. The 
               troops kept on firing until their ammunition was exhausted. At least 1000 people were killed and over 
               1,200 other people were injured of whom 192 were seriously injured.
<br>
<br>
Responses polarized both the British and Indian peoples. Eminent author Rudyard Kipling declared at the time that Dyer 
"did his duty as he saw it". This incident shocked Rabindranath Tagore (the first Indian and Asian Nobel laureate) to 
such an extent that he renounced his knighthood and stated that "such mass murderers aren't worthy of giving any title to 
anyone".
<br>
<br>
The massacre caused a re-evaluation by the British Army of its military role against civilians to minimal force whenever 
possible, although later British actions during the Mau Mau insurgencies in Kenya have led historian Huw Bennett to note 
that the new policy was not always carried out. The army was retrained and developed less violent tactics for crowd 
control.
<br>
<br>
The level of casual brutality, and lack of any accountability, stunned the entire nation, resulting in a wrenching l
oss of faith of the general Indian public in the intentions of the UK. The ineffective inquiry, together with the 
initial accolades for Dyer, fuelled great widespread anger against the British among the Indian populace, leading to the
 Non-cooperation movement of 1920–22. Some historians consider the episode a decisive step towards the end of British 
 rule in India.
 <br>
 <br>
Britain never formally apologised for the massacre but expressed "regret" in 2019.
