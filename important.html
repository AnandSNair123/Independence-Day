                1885 – The Indian National Congress (also known as the Congress Party/INC) was created and became India’s 
                major political party.
<br>
<br>
The party became the Nation’s leader in the Independence Movement in its struggle against the British Empire.
<br>
<br>
1915 – Gandhiji returned to India and joined the Indian National Congress.
<br>
<br>
He took leadership of Congress in 1920 and began agitating against the British.
<br>
<br>
On  January 26, 1930, the Indian National Congress declared the independence of India which the British did not recognize.
<br>
<br>
1916 – Lucknow Pact was an agreement reached between the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League.
<br>
<br>
Muhammed Ali Jinnah, then a member of the Congress as well as the League, made both the parties reach an agreement to pressure the British government to adopt a more liberal approach to India and give Indians more authority to run their country.
<br>
<br>
1919 – The tragic Jallianwala Bagh massacre took place on April 13.
<br>
<br>
This event in which Brigadier-General Reginald E.H. Dyer ordered indiscriminate firing at a crowd including women and children, killing hundreds of them, caused much resentment and anger among the people and led to the Non-Cooperation Movement.
<br>
<br>
1920 – The Non-Cooperation Movement was a significant phase of the Indian struggle for freedom.
<br>
<br>
Protestors would refuse to buy British goods, adopt the use of local handicrafts, picket liquor shops, and try to uphold the Indian values of honor and integrity.
<br>
<br>
1935 – The Government of India Act and the creation of a new constitution laid the foundations for the events that would follow in the next decade and thereafter.
<br>
<br>
1940 – England’s involvement in the Second World War weakened the British Empire.
<br>
<br>
After shaking off the effects of the First World War this war caused the thinning of the British resources and would be significant in deciding India’s future.
<br>
<br>
1942 – The Quit India movement called for the immediate withdrawal of the British from India and the British responded by putting most of the INC leadership in jail.
